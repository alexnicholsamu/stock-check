# use gpt to give me model to predict future stock prices, using kaggle dataset (this would be hard, would need to
# train it on a specific csv, that would be difficult and involve downloading a ton, or can train it on a total dataset
# which would make the model less accurate) then use model to predict stock outcome

# future future code would be involving the sentiment analysis in those predictions
